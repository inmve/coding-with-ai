  ## What Makes a Good Technique

  - **Real usage** - You actually use this, not just theory
  - **Specific** - "Ask Claude to refactor while preserving tests" not "use AI for refactoring"
  - **Actionable** - Others can immediately try it
  - **Quote-worthy** - You can describe your experience with it
