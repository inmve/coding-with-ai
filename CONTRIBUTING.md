# Contributing to Coding with AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project thrives on real developer experiences with AI coding tools.

## How to Contribute

### Share Your Experience
Have experience with an existing technique? Your real-world usage helps others understand what actually works.

**To share your experience:**
1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/inmve/coding-with-ai/issues/new)
2. Include:
   - Which technique you used
   - Your specific experience (what worked, what didn't)
   - Any tips or variations you discovered
   - The AI tool you used (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)

### Suggest New Techniques
Know a technique that should be included? We're always looking for proven patterns that deliver real productivity gains.

**To suggest a new technique:**
1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/inmve/coding-with-ai/issues/new)
2. Include:
   - The technique name and description
   - How you actually use it (with specific examples)
   - Why it's valuable (productivity impact)
   - A quote about your experience with it

### General Feedback

- Email [hi@coding-with-ai.dev](mailto:hi@coding-with-ai.dev)

## What Makes a Good Technique

We're looking for techniques that meet these criteria:

- **Real usage** - You actually use this, not just theory
- **Specific** - "Ask Claude to refactor while preserving tests" not "use AI for refactoring"  
- **Actionable** - Others can immediately try it
- **Quote-worthy** - You can describe your experience with it

## Examples of Good Contributions

### Good Technique Suggestion
> "I use 'Write Tests First, Then Code' - I have Claude write comprehensive tests based on expected behavior, then iterate on implementation until all tests pass. This caught so many edge cases I would have missed. Here's exactly how I do it: [specific steps]"

### Good Experience Share
> "I tried 'Run Multiple Agents in Parallel' using git worktrees. It was game-changing for my workflow. I run Claude on auth features while Cursor builds the UI. Cut my development time by 3x. One tip: always create separate branches first."

## Contribution Guidelines

- Focus on **practical implementation details**, not theory
- Include **specific commands, configurations, or prompts** you use
- Share **honest experiences** - what didn't work is as valuable as what did
- Mention **which AI tools** you used (different tools may require different approaches)
- Provide **concrete examples** from real projects when possible

## Questions?

Not sure if your contribution fits? Just submit it! We'd rather see more ideas than miss good ones. The community will help refine and improve submissions.

Thank you for helping make AI coding more effective for everyone! ðŸš€
